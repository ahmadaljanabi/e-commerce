# E-commerce Website

E-commerce website will use JavaScript front to back for simplicity and not to be overwhelm with other languages out there. Many programming languages that used for developing a website does not have the huge community and sources to learn and go deep like JavaScript which is why I recommend choosing it. Before that, I was learning web development with Python using Django framework which was very easy, secure, and speed up my process while doing so. Although, it was not the best option because the lack of community and resources and it was hardly complex to create exactly what you want. Finally, focusing on one programming language and dominant in the market is the best option to go with. so, whenever we are stuck we can find many ways to solve our problems.
